<h2 align='center'>Introduction</h2>

This dotfile repository provides me with a method to keep organized, up-to-date and never out of sync.

I currently am running macOS 10.15 "Catalina". I currently use Homebrew for package management. All dotfiles are tailored to Homebrew, zsh, etc.

This repository will eventually contain color-schemes, command-line tools, environment configurations, fonts, and desktop customizations that make-up my personal OS environment.

A personal thank you to these resources, who helped me get set up and on my way. ðŸ˜„
